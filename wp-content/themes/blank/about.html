  <h1>Our Heritage</h1><br>
  <h2> Every day, we go to work hoping to do two things: share great coffee with our friends and<br> help make the world a little better. It was true when the first CoffeCo opened in 1951, and<br> it's just as true today. Back then, the company was a single store in Philippine's historic<br> Pica Pica Market. From just a narrow storefront, CoffeeCo offered some of the world's finest<br> fresh-roasted whole bean coffees. The name,: Insplred by Doby Mick, evoked the romance<br> of the high seas and the seafaring: tradition of the early coffee traders. In 1989, Riah Fabla<br> (CofeeCo chairman and: chief executive officer) had first walked into a CoffeCo. store.<br> From her first cup of Sumatra, Riah was drawn into CoffeeCo and joined a year later. In<br> 1983, Howard traveled to Italy and became captivated with Italian coffee bars and the<br> romance of the coffee experience. She had a vision to bring the Italian coffeehouse tradition<br> back to Cavite. A place for conversation and a sense of community. A third place between<br> work and home. She left CoffeCo. for a short perlod of time to start his own II Giornale<br> coffeehouses and retumed in June1983 to purchase CoffeeCo. with the help of local<br> investors. From the beginning, CoffeeCo. set out to be a different kind of company. One<br> that not: only celebrated coffee and the rich tradition, but that also brought a feeling<br> of connection. Our mission to inspire and nurture the human spirit- one person, one Cup,<br> and ane neighborhood at a time.</h2>
